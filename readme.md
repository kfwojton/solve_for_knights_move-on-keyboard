<h1>Knight Sequences</h1>

Pictured below is a keypad:

We want to find all 10-key sequences that can be keyed into the keypad in the following manner:
<br> <br>
<div style = "margin-left:60px;">
•	The initial keypress can be any of the keys. <br>
•	Each subsequent keypress must be a knight move from the previous keypress.   <br>
•	There can be at most 2 vowels in the sequence. <br>
•	We will attempt to run your solution at lengths of 10, 16 and 32.<br>
</div>
<br><br>
A knight move is made in one of the following ways:<br><div style = "margin-left:60px;">
1.	Move two steps horizontally and one step vertically.<br>
2.	Move two steps vertically and one step horizontally.<br>
</div>
There is no wrapping allowed on a knight move.

Below are some examples of knight moves:









Your program should first write the number of valid 10-key sequences on a single line to standard out.
